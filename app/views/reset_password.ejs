Hi
<br/>
Have you requested help because you forgot your password to the Researcher Dashboard?
<br/>
If you did NOT request that help, then someone entered your email address and requested to reset your password. No need to reset the password in that case.
<br/>
If you requested help because you forgot your password, please click <a href="<%= data.url %>">here</a>, or paste the following url into the address bar of your browser to reset your password: <%= data.url %>.
<br/>
If you have any questions, please email the Researcher Dashboard Admin at andydzik@gmail.com.
<br/>
Thanks,

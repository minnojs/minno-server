    The sorting test you just took is called the Implicit Association Test (IAT). 
    You categorized good and bad words with images of <%= global.blackLabels %> and <%= global.whiteLabels %>.
</p>

<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-dark">
    <h2>Here are your results:</h2>
    <p><%= global.raceiat.feedback %></p>
</div>

<h3>Interpreting your results</h3>
<p>
    Your result is described as an "Automatic preference for <%= global.blackLabels %> over <%= global.whiteLabels %>" 
    if you were faster responding when <i><%= global.blackLabels %></i> and <i>Good</i> are assigned to the same response key than when <i><%= global.whiteLabels %></i> and <i>Good</i> were classified with the same key.
    Your score is described as an "Automatic preference for <%= global.whiteLabels %> over <%= global.blackLabels %>" if the opposite occurred.
</p>
<p>
    Your automatic preference may be described as "slight", "moderate", "strong", or "no preference". 
    This indicates the <i>strength</i> of your automatic preference.
</p>
<p>
    The IAT requires a certain number of correct responses in order to get results.
    If you made too many errors while completing the test you will get the feedback that there were too many errors to determine a result.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note that your IAT result is based only on the categorization task and not on the questions that you answered.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Disclaimer: </strong>
    These results are not a definitive assessment of your implicit preference.
    The results may be influenced by variables related to the test (e.g., the category labels or particular items used to represent the categories on the IAT) 
    or the person (e.g., how tired you are).
    The results are provided for educational purposes only.
<p>

<h3>How Does The IAT Work?</h3>
<p>
    The IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts (e.g., <%= global.blackLabels %>, <%= global.whiteLabels %>) and attributes (e.g., Good and Bad). 
    The main idea is that making a response is easier when closely related items share the same response key. 
    We would say that one has an implicit preference for <%= global.blackLabels %> relative to <%= global.whiteLabels %>if they are faster to categorize words when <%= global.blackLabels %> and Good share a response key relative to when <%= global.blackLabels %> and Bad share a response key.
</p>
<p>
    Any single IAT is unlikely to predict behavior well for a specific individual.
    In the aggregate, the IAT can predict behavior such as discrimination in hiring and promotion, medical treatment, and decisions related to criminal justice.
</p>

<h3> Does The Order In Which I Took The IAT Matter?</h3>
<p>
    Yes, the order in which you take the IAT can influence your overall results. 
    But, the effect is very small.
    So if you first pair <%= global.blackLabels %> + Good / <%= global.whiteLabels %> + Bad and then pair <%= global.whiteLabels %> + Bad / <%= global.blackLabels %>+ Good, 
    your results might be a just a tiny bit different than they would be if you had done the reverse pairing first. 
    To minimize the order effect, we give more practice trials before the second pairing than we did before the first pairing. 
    We also randomly assign participants to one of the two possible orderings, 
    so half of the test-takers complete 
    <%= global.blackLabels %> + Good / <%= global.whiteLabels %> + Bad and then <%= global.whiteLabels %> + Bad / <%= global.blackLabels %>+ Good, 
    and the other half get the opposite order.
